The UKIS-pysat package provides generic classes and functions to access and process multi-spectral and SAR satellite images.


### file
Work with you local satellite data files and read information out of file names and metadata files. Currently, focusing on Sentinel-1.


### raster
Reading satellite data and performing simple, but cumbersome tasks. This is just a layer on top of [rasterio](https://github.com/mapbox/rasterio) for stuff we often need. It can very well be that using *rasterio* directly is often the better choice.


Read the documentation for more details: [https://ukis-pysat.readthedocs.io](https://ukis-pysat.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Example
Here's an example about some basic features, it might also help to read through the [tests](https://github.com/dlr-eoc/ukis-pysat/blob/master/tests).
###Sentinel Dataset

```python
# import all the required libraries
from ukis_pysat.file import get_sentinel_scene_from_dir
from ukis_pysat.raster import Image


# get sentinel scene from directory
with get_sentinel_scene_from_dir("/users/username/tmp") as (full_path, ident):
    with Image(full_path.join("pre_nrcs.tif")) as img:
        # scale the image array, having one band
        img.arr = img.arr * 0.3
```
For working with the Landsat we need an item id for downloading the product
Check [Pystac](https://pystac.readthedocs.io/en/1.0/) documentation for more functionality on [STAC](https://stacspec.org/).


## Installation
The easiest way to install `ukis-pysat` is through pip. Be aware, that Rasterio requires GDAL >= 1.11, < 3.1.

Most users will want to do this:
```shell
pip install ukis-pysat[complete]  # install everything
```

There's also some lighter versions with less dependencies:

```shell
pip install ukis-pysat  # only install core dependencies (ukis_pysat.file can be used)

pip install ukis-pysat[data]  # also install dependencies for ukis_pysat.data

pip install ukis-pysat[raster]  # also install dependencies for ukis_pysat.raster
```

Some helper functions might need additional dependencies like `pandas`, `dask[array]` or `utm`. If this is the case you will receive an `ImportError`.


### Dependencies
For the latest list of dependencies check the [requirements](https://github.com/dlr-eoc/ukis-pysat/blob/master/requirements.txt).

## What is UKIS?
The DLR project Environmental and Crisis Information System (the German abbreviation is UKIS, standing for [Umwelt- und Kriseninformationssysteme](https://www.dlr.de/eoc/en/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-5413/10560_read-21914/) aims at harmonizing the development of information systems at the German Remote Sensing Data Center (DFD) and setting up a framework of modularized and generalized software components.

UKIS is intended to ease and standardize the process of setting up specific information systems and thus bridging the gap from EO product generation and information fusion to the delivery of products and information to end users.

Furthermore, the intention is to save and broaden know-how that was and is invested and earned in the development of information systems and components in several ongoing and future DFD projects.
